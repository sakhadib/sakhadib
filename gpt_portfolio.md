# Adib Sakhawat

## Academic Background
Adib Sakhawat is a budding software engineer from Bangladesh, currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at the Islamic University of Technology (IUT) ([sakhadib (Adib Sakhawat) · GitHub](https://github.com/sakhadib#:~:text=Adib%20Sakhawat)) ([sakhadib - Codeforces](https://mirror.codeforces.com/profile/sakhadib#:~:text=Adib%20Sakhawat%2C%20Rajshahi%20%2C%20,95)). IUT is a prestigious engineering university in Dhaka (Gazipur), and Adib is part of the Software Engineering program cohort (SWE). He is a diligent student who actively supplements his formal education with self-driven learning. For instance, alongside his university coursework, Adib completed Kaggle’s **Intro to Machine Learning** online course, earning a certificate for successfully finishing it ([Adib Sakhawat completed the Intro to Machine Learning ... - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/certification/sakhadib/intro-to-machine-learning#:~:text=Adib%20Sakhawat%20completed%20the%20Intro,course%20Intro%20to%20Machine%20Learning)). This initiative reflects his enthusiasm to broaden his skills beyond the classroom and stay updated with industry-relevant knowledge.

Adib’s academic interests span software design, algorithms, and practical problem solving. He believes in writing high-quality software – in his own words, he thinks the world *“would be much better with perfect softwares”* ([sakhadib (Adib Sakhawat) · GitHub](https://github.com/sakhadib#:~:text=Software%20Engineering%20Student%20at%20Islamic,much%20better%20with%20perfect%20softwares)). This philosophy drives him to refine his coding abilities and strive for excellence in his projects and assignments. By engaging in both university projects and online challenges, he has built a strong foundation in software engineering principles during his time at IUT ([sakhadib (Adib Sakhawat) · GitHub](https://github.com/sakhadib#:~:text=Adib%20Sakhawat)).

## Notable Projects
Adib has worked on several noteworthy projects during his studies, showcasing creativity and a range of technical skills. Some of his notable projects include:

- **MathRanker:** An innovative web platform for mathematical contests and problem-solving communities ([GitHub - sakhadib/MathRanker](https://github.com/sakhadib/MathRanker#:~:text=match%20at%20L236%20MathRanker%20is,robust%20frontend%20and%20backend%20infrastructure)). MathRanker provides a dynamic online space where math enthusiasts can participate in regular contests, solve problems, and engage with a community of peers. Built using a full-stack approach (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP/MySQL, Bootstrap), the platform offers a robust environment aimed at *“redefin[ing] the landscape of math competition platforms, fostering collaboration, recognition, and growth within the mathematical community”* ([GitHub - sakhadib/MathRanker](https://github.com/sakhadib/MathRanker#:~:text=MathRanker%20is%20an%20innovative%20web,robust%20frontend%20and%20backend%20infrastructure)). This project illustrates Adib’s ability to design and develop a complex web application catering to a specialized educational community.

- **IUT SWE Question Bank:** A public repository compiling question papers and study resources for the Software Engineering program at IUT ([sakhadib (Adib Sakhawat) · GitHub](https://github.com/sakhadib#:~:text=1,Public)). Adib created the **IUT_SWE_QuestionBank** to help fellow students by gathering past exam questions and materials (“the question bank for [the] Software Engineering Program in IUT” ([sakhadib (Adib Sakhawat) · GitHub](https://github.com/sakhadib#:~:text=1,Public))). This project demonstrates his initiative in community building and academic collaboration, as it serves as a valuable resource for peers to prepare for exams and understand course materials.

- **VMath Library:** A custom Java-based mathematics library focused on efficient computations and a wide range of mathematical methods ([sakhadib (Adib Sakhawat) · GitHub](https://github.com/sakhadib#:~:text=3,Public)). In this **vmath** project, Adib implemented various mathematical functions and algorithms with an emphasis on performance (“more efficiency and lots of methods” ([sakhadib (Adib Sakhawat) · GitHub](https://github.com/sakhadib#:~:text=3,Public))). Developing this library allowed him to explore advanced programming techniques in Java and optimize algorithms, reflecting his strong interest in mathematics and software optimization.

- **Daily Cat Extension:** A simple and fun Chrome browser extension that displays a random cat picture whenever the extension icon is clicked ([GitHub - sakhadib/Daily_Cat_Extension](https://github.com/sakhadib/Daily_Cat_Extension#:~:text=Daily%20Cat)). Adib built **Daily_Cat_Extension** as a lighthearted project to learn how browser extensions work. According to its description, “Daily Cat is a Chrome web extension that shows you a cat picture when you click on the extension icon” ([GitHub - sakhadib/Daily_Cat_Extension](https://github.com/sakhadib/Daily_Cat_Extension#:~:text=Daily%20Cat)). This project, though small, showcases Adib’s curiosity and willingness to learn new platforms and technologies (in this case, web extension development) – and it adds a bit of daily joy for users who install it.

*(In addition to the above, Adib has developed dozens of other projects on GitHub – as of 2025, his GitHub profile lists 50+ repositories ranging from academic assignments to personal experiments – underscoring his prolific coding practice.)*
